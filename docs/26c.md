# Problem  26c.

Let \(S\) be a semigroup with an element \(e\) such that \(ea = a\) for all \(a \in S\) and such that for every \(a \in S\) there exists \(a^{-1} \in S\) for which \(a^{-1}a = e\). Prove that \(S\) is a group.

## Proof

We need to show 
<!-- group axioms -->
0. Closure
1. Associativity
2. Existence of the identity element
3. Existence of an inverse for all elements of \(S\)

Closure and associativity we get for free, since \(S\) is a semigroup, and semigroups by definition have this property. 

We also have the *left* identity and inverse \(\forall a \in S\), so what we really need to show is that there exist the *right* identity element and inverse for all elements of \(S\).

Let's multiply \(a^{-1}a=e\) from the left, we get \(a^{-1}a=e\)
