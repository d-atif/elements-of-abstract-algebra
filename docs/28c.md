# Exercise  28c.

A group \(G\) is *isomorphic* to a group \(G'\) if there exists a one-to-one correspondence \(\phi \colon G \rightarrow G'\) such that \(\phi(ab)=\phi(a)\phi(b)\), or in other words, such that \(\phi\) preserves group products. Show that such a mapping \(\phi\) (called an *isomorphism*) preserves identity elements and inverses.

---

## *Proof*
We need to show two things:

1. That \(\phi\) preserves the identity element: \(\phi(e_G)\phi(g)=\phi(g)=\phi(g)\phi(e_G)\)
2. That \(\phi\) preserves the inverse element: \(\phi(g^{-1})\phi(g)= \phi(e_G)=\phi(g)\phi(g^{-1})\)

where \(e_G\) is the identity element of \(G\).

### *Proof* of 1
Let \(G' \neq \varnothing\) and let \(g' \in G'\). Since \(\phi\) is a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection), there exists a \(g \in G\) such that \(g'=\phi(g)\). Now, since \(\phi\) preserves the group product, we have the following
\[g'=\phi(g)=\phi(e_Gg)=\phi(e_G)\phi(g)=\phi(e_G)g'\]
We have shown that \(\phi(e_G)g'=g'\), and we get \(g'\phi(e_G)=g'\) analogously, which means that \(\phi\) preserves the identity element, which means that \(\phi(e_G)\) is the identity element of the group \(G'\). The proof of 1. is complete.

### *Proof* of 2
Let \(g \in G\). Since \(G\) is a group, \(g\) has an inverse \(g^{-1} \in G\). Consider the following equalities, which utilize the fact that \(\phi\) preserves the group product:
\[\phi(g^{-1})\phi(g) = \phi(g^{-1}g) = \phi(e_G)\]
We got that \(\phi(g^{-1})\phi(g)=\phi(e_G)\), and we can analogously show that \(\phi(e_G)=\phi(g)\phi(g^{-1})\). This shows that \(\phi(g^{-1})\) is the inverse of \(\phi(g)\) (in the group product sense), that is, \(\phi(g^{-1}) = \phi(g)^{-1}\).

We've proven both 1. and 2., the isomorphism \(\phi\) indeed preserves the identity and inverse elements. The proof is complete.
