I didn't solve any exercises from this section because of two reasons: 1. I took a set theory course last year and 2. I'm studying this book for abstract algebra/group theory specifically. If you want to contribute solutions for **this** section, you can send me solutions or make pull requests via github, [here is the repository link](https://github.com/d-atif/elements-of-abstract-algebra). If you decide to do so, there is a "exercise-template.md" file and solved exercises from Group Theory section that you can use as a reference, for the purposes of stylistic uniformity. As of now I'm not sure how would I credit other people for their solutions, but we can figure this out if any solutions happen to be contributed.
