Show that a nonempty subset H of a group G is a subgroup of G if and only if a, b \\in H implies ab^{-1} \\in H . Proof We assume a, b \\in H implies ab^{-1} \\in H is true, and we want to show that H is a subgroup of G . To do this, we need to show that: 1. a \\in H \\implies a^{-1} \\in H , 2. a, b \\in H \\implies ab \\in H . Proof for (1): a \\in H \\implies a^{-1} \\in H Let a \\in H . By our assumption, for b = a , we get: aa^{-1} = e, where e is the identity element of G . So, we know that the identity element e is in H . Now, since e, a \\in H , again using the assumption, we get: ea^{-1} = a^{-1}. Thus, we have shown that a \\in H \\implies a^{-1} \\in H , and the proof for (1) is complete. Proof for (2): a, b \\in H \\implies ab \\in H Let a, b \\in H . By (1), we know that b \\in H \\implies b^{-1} \\in H . Now, since a, b^{-1} \\in H , by the starting assumption, we get: a(b^{-1})^{-1} = ab. Thus, we have shown that a, b \\in H \\implies ab \\in H , and the proof for (2) is complete. Since (1) and (2) are true, H is indeed a subgroup of G , and the statement is proven.","title":"Problem 35a."},{"location":"35a/#problem-35a","text":"Show that a nonempty subset H of a group G is a subgroup of G if and only if a, b \\in H implies ab^{-1} \\in H .","title":"Problem 35a."},{"location":"35a/#proof","text":"We assume a, b \\in H implies ab^{-1} \\in H is true, and we want to show that H is a subgroup of G .
