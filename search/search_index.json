A semigroup is a set S with a product which associates to each ordered pair (a, b) of elements of S an element ab \\in S in such a way that (ab)c = a(bc) for any elements a, b, c \\in S . Show that the set of all mappings from a given set X to itself forms a semigroup in which the product is composition of mappings. Show that the set of all one-to-one correspondences of X with itself forms a group under composition. Proof We have two things to show: Show that the set of all mappings from a given set X to itself forms a semigroup in which the product is composition of mappings. Show that the set of all one-to-one correspondences of X with itself forms a group under composition. Proof of 1. Let \\mathcal F = \\mathcal F(X) be the set of all functions X \\rightarrow X . We need to show that (fg)h = f(gh) for all f, g, h \\in \\mathcal F We know this is true because composition of function is associative, and we know we can compose the functions since f, g, h share one the same domain and codomain, namely X , since f, g, h \\in \\mathcal F . Proof of 2. One-to-one correspondence (not to be confused with the one-to-one function, which is synonymous with an injective mapping), is a synonym for a bijection, that is, a function that is both surjective and injective. Let \\mathcal B = \\mathcal B (X) be the set of all bijective functions (bijections) X \\rightarrow X . We need to show that this set is a group under composition, that is, that the group axioms are true in this set, when we equip it with the composition operation. Closure: We know from set theory that a composition of bijections is a bijection, therefore f, g \\in \\mathcal B \\implies fg \\in \\mathcal B, \\forall f,g \\in \\mathcal B Associativity: Since \\mathcal B \\subset \\mathcal F , \\mathcal B is a subgroup as well and thus the associativity axiom is inherited. Existence of the identity element: The identity function, defined with 1(x) := x, \\forall x \\in X is a bijection, and we know from set theory that 1f = f = f1 is true for all functions, and particularly for bijections.

Let me explain some of these connections. In this problem we get introduced to the \"semigroup\", which is an algebraic structure \"weaker\" than the group, meaning that we are necessitating less 2 rules which it has to obey, i.e. we don't care about identity elements, or inverse elements in a semigroup. So, what if we wanted to define an algebraic structure that's a little stronger than the semigroup, and add, say, the identity element axiom to its definition? This would give us the monoid , which is essentially a semigroup + identity element axiom. So if we order these structures by their \"strength\", we get the following ordering: semigroup < monoid < group (or, every group is a monoid and a semigroup, every monoid is a semigroup, see image below). Here is where the connection with category theory comes in: A category with just one object is a monoid. A category with just one object, but where all the morphisms are invertible is a group. Zounds! Here is a MSE thread with some nice answers that explains the connection with groups in particular, towards which this problem hints at, if you are familiar with the definition of a category. image from wikipedia I'll often use results from set theory like this, I took a set theory course last year and I want to focus on algebra, because of that I won't be descending to the set theory realm, and will use those results as given.

Proof (faulty, read below) Note: This proof is wrong, feel free to find the mistake. Link to correct solution and more comments below in the Additional thoughts section. Once again, we need to prove that the group axioms are true for S . Closure: S is a semigroup, so by definition closure holds in S . Associativity: Same as closure. Existence of the identity element: Let's assume S \\neq \\varnothing , this means \\exists a \\in S . Consider now the following set A=\\{a^n \\colon a \\in S, n \\in \\mathbb N\\} We know the following two things: \\varnothing \\neq A \\subseteq S . That A is not empty we know because a^1 \\in A .

To prove that this really is the identity element, it will suffice to prove that they are all the same element. More precisely, we want to show a^ka^{n-m} = a^k \\ \\forall k \\in \\mathbb N , and we can do this by induction. For k=1 we know it's true. Now we assume it's true for k .

I started this problem just playing around with the assumptions. The \" \\implies \" direction was very straightforward. For the \" \\Longleftarrow \" direction I again just started playing with the given assumption, trying to see if something will pop up. Along the way I noticed I could prove a^{-1} \\in H if e, a \\in H . But to do that I needed to show that e is in H . Then as I was moving symbols around, I realised that I can set b = a and use the assumption to show that e \\in H . While I was pretty sure I can set b=a due to my prior experience with proofs, I still had some doubts. I thought, there is no b \\neq a condition, so who says I can't put b = a ? I found this answer on MSE, here they brought to my attention the actual name of this rule of inference that allows us to to set a = x, b = y for whatever x, y \\in H . Also note that I used the same letters for the assumption and in the reasoning, the linked answer does it better by introducing the variable x . Right now I'm too lazy to change this in my proof, so I leave it as it is.","title":"Additional thoughts"},{"location":"Group%20Theory%20Remarks/","text":"","title":"Group Theory Remarks"},{"location":"Set%20Theory%20Remarks/","text":"I didn't solve any problems from this section because of two reasons: 1.
