A semigroup is a set S with a product which associates to each ordered pair (a, b) of elements of S an element ab \\in S in such a way that (ab)c = a(bc) for any elements a, b, c \\in S . Show that the set of all mappings from a given set X to itself forms a semigroup in which the product is composition of mappings. Show that the set of all one-to-one correspondences of X with itself forms a group under composition. Proof We have two things to show: Show that the set of all mappings from a given set X to itself forms a semigroup in which the product is composition of mappings. Show that the set of all one-to-one correspondences of X with itself forms a group under composition. Proof of 1. Let \\mathcal F = \\mathcal F(X) be the set of all functions X \\rightarrow X . We need to show that (fg)h = f(gh) for all f, g, h \\in \\mathcal F We know this is true because composition of function is associative, and we know we can compose the functions since f, g, h share one the same domain and codomain, namely X , since f, g, h \\in \\mathcal F . Proof of 2. One-to-one correspondence (not to be confused with the one-to-one function, which is synonymous with an injective mapping), is a synonym for a bijection, that is, a function that is both surjective and injective. Let \\mathcal B = \\mathcal B (X) be the set of all bijective functions (bijections) X \\rightarrow X . We need to show that this set is a group under composition, that is, that the group axioms are true in this set, when we equip it with the composition operation. Closure: We know from set theory that a composition of bijections is a bijection, therefore f, g \\in \\mathcal B \\implies fg \\in \\mathcal B, \\forall f,g \\in \\mathcal B Associativity: Since \\mathcal B \\subset \\mathcal F , \\mathcal B is a subgroup as well and thus the associativity axiom is inherited. Existence of the identity element: The identity function, defined with 1(x) := x, \\forall x \\in X is a bijection, and we know from set theory that 1f = f = f1 is true for all functions, and particularly for bijections.

Let me explain some of these connections. In this exercise we get introduced to the \"semigroup\", which is an algebraic structure \"weaker\" than the group, meaning that we are necessitating less 2 rules which it has to obey, i.e. we don't care about identity elements, or inverse elements in a semigroup. So, what if we wanted to define an algebraic structure that's a little stronger than the semigroup, and add, say, the identity element axiom to its definition? This would give us the monoid , which is essentially a semigroup + identity element axiom. So if we order these structures by their \"strength\", we get the following ordering: semigroup < monoid < group (or, every group is a monoid and a semigroup, every monoid is a semigroup, see image below). Here is where the connection with category theory comes in: A category with just one object is a monoid. A category with just one object, but where all the morphisms are invertible is a group. Zounds!

Let S be a semigroup with an element e such that ea = a for all a \\in S and such that for every a \\in S there exists a^{-1} \\in S for which a^{-1}a = e . Prove that S is a group. Proof We need to show that the usual group axioms are true for S , that is: Closure Associativity Existence of the identity element Existence of an inverse for all elements of S Closure and associativity we get for free, since S is a semigroup, and semigroups by definition have these properties. We are also given the existence of the left identity and the left inverse, so what we really need to show is that there exists the right identity element for all elements in S and the right inverse of all elements of S . The updated goals are: (i) Existence of the right identity element (ii) Existence of the right inverse element Let's prove (ii) first. Also, we will be using the associative property freely, without explicitly mentioning that we used it later on. Proof of (ii): We need to show that for all a \\in S there exists a^{-1} such that aa^{-1}=e . Let a \\in S . Then, by assumption we know that there exists a^{-1} \\in S that is the left inverse of a . Now, since a^{-1} \\in S , using the same assumption, we get that there exists the inverse of this element in S , namely, there exists (a^{-1})^{-1} \\in S \\colon (a^{-1})^{-1}a^{-1}=e , and let's define b \\colon = (a^{-1})^{-1} . Now we can write the last equality compactly as ba^{-1}=e . Consider now the equation a^{-1}a = e that we are given, and let's multiply it with b from the left, we get the following: \\begin{align} a^{-1}a &= e &\\iff\\\\ b(a^{-1}a) &= be &\\iff \\\\ (ba^{-1})a &= be &\\iff \\\\ ea &= be &\\iff \\\\ a &= be \\end{align} Now we use the same reasoning as before and deduce that, since b \\in S , that means that there is b^{-1} \\in S \\colon b^{-1}b = e . Combining this with what we have derived so far we get ba^{-1} = e = b^{-1}b \\implies ba^{-1}=b^{-1}b Let's manipulate this last equality using everything we know so far: \\begin{align} ba^{-1} &= b^{-1}b &\\iff \\\\ b(ea^{-1}) &= e &\\iff \\\\ (be)a^{-1} &= e &\\iff \\\\ aa^{-1} &= e &\\iff \\\\ \\end{align} Thus we obtain the desired the existence of the right inverse, (ii) is proven. Proof of (i): For this part, we need to show that there exists e \\in S: ae=a for all (a \\in S). Consider the product ae , since S is a semigroup, we have that ae \\in S . Let's rewrite ae using the given assumption about the existence of the left identity element, and let's proceed from there using the results we obtained in (ii): \\begin{align} ae &= a(a^{-1}a) &\\iff \\\\ ae &= (aa^{-1})a &\\iff \\\\ ae &= ea \\end{align} The last equality being what we wanted show, thus (i) is proven.

Initially, I failed to prove this and skipped it. When I returned to it, it took me probably 3 hours to solve it, split across multiple sessions. Not sure why I struggled so much. I was sleep deprived though, and a little burnt out from exams.

Proof (faulty, read below) Note: This proof is wrong, feel free to find the mistake. Link to correct solution and more comments below in the Additional thoughts section. Once again, we need to prove that the group axioms are true for S . Closure: S is a semigroup, so by definition closure holds in S . Associativity: Same as closure. Existence of the identity element: Let's assume S \\neq \\varnothing , this means \\exists a \\in S . Consider now the following set A=\\{a^n \\colon a \\in S, n \\in \\mathbb N\\} We know the following two things: \\varnothing \\neq A \\subseteq S . That A is not empty we know because a^1 \\in A . And we know A is a subset of S since we have, by induction and closure of the semigroup, a^{n} \\in S \\ \\forall n \\in \\mathbb N . Now, by Dirichlet's (aka pigeonhole) principle, since A is finite, and \\mathbb N is infinite, there must exist n, m \\in \\mathbb N \\colon n < m for which we have a^n = a^m \\tag 1 Expanding the semigroup products on both sides of this equality: \\begin{align} \\underbrace {(a \\dots a)}_{m-1 \\ as}\\underbrace{(a \\dots a)}_{n-m+1 \\ as} = \\underbrace {(a \\dots a)}_{m-1 \\ as} a &\\implies a^{n-m+1} = a \\tag 2\\\\ & \\iff a^{n-m}a = a \\\\ & \\iff aa^{n-m} = a \\end {align} Above we used the associativity of the semigroup, and the left cancellation law. So, we found an element e=a^{n-m} that leaves a invariant, i.e. we proved that every element has its own identity. To prove that this really is the identity element, it will suffice to prove that they are all the same element. More precisely, we want to show a^ka^{n-m} = a^k \\ \\forall k \\in \\mathbb N , and we can do this by induction. For k=1 we know it's true. Now we assume it's true for k . Then for k+1 we have a^{k+1}a^{n-m}=a^kaa^{n-m}=a^ka^{n-m}=a^k , the last equality being true by the inductive hypothesis. Thus we've shown that all the elements have the one and the same identity element, hence S has the identity element. Existence of an inverse for all elements of S : Continuing the reasoning from above, consider the following e=a^{n-m}=aa^{n-m-1}=a^{n-m-1}a the above equalities being true by associativity. But this tells us that for an arbitrary a \\in S its inverse is a^{n-m-1} . It just remains to consider what if n-m = 1 since then the inverse would be a^0 and we don't know whether this element is in S . For this case, we would have e=a^{n-m}=a^1=a , in particular ae=a=e , thus in this case as well a is invertible. We proved everything that needed to be proved, the proof is complete. \\(\\square\\) Additional thoughts If you just want the correct and arguably better solution of this exercise, here you go: A finite, cancellative semigroup is a group . As in for the mentioned mistake, I believe that we showed that only the set A\\subseteq S has the identity element, but we didn't do so for the whole semigroup S . Only after typing up this proof I realized this mistake, so I decided to leave it as an example of a faulty proof, for educational purposes.

But this tells us that for an arbitrary a \\in S its inverse is a^{n-m-1} . It just remains to consider what if n-m = 1 since then the inverse would be a^0 and we don't know whether this element is in S . For this case, we would have e=a^{n-m}=a^1=a , in particular ae=a=e , thus in this case as well a is invertible. We proved everything that needed to be proved, the proof is complete. \\(\\square\\)","title":"Proof (faulty, read below)"},{"location":"26d/#additional-thoughts","text":"If you just want the correct and arguably better solution of this exercise, here you go: A finite, cancellative semigroup is a group . As in for the mentioned mistake, I believe that we showed that only the set A\\subseteq S has the identity element, but we didn't do so for the whole semigroup S . Only after typing up this proof I realized this mistake, so I decided to leave it as an example of a faulty proof, for educational purposes.

Let a be an element of a group G . Show that the mapping \\lambda_a\\colon G \\rightarrow G given by \\lambda_a g = ag for any g \\in G is a one-to-one correspondence.

Our goal here will be to prove that the \\lambda_a mapping is both surjective and injective. Proof of \\lambda_a being injective Since a \\in G , G is non-empty.

Not only that every element of a group can be expressed as a product of two elements of the group, but this exercise tells us that every element can be expressed as a product of two elements of the group, given that one is fixed.
