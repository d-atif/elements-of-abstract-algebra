I'll also post problems I asked about on Math Stack Exchange, probably with accompanying thoughts on what I learned. If you find mistakes, or have suggestions, please do let me know. If you would like to discuss a particular problem, or whatever, I'd be happy to hear from you. You can find my contact info at the bottom. When I finish with the book, I plan to enable direct contributions from other people via github, in case someone wants to help make this a complete collection of solutions for this book. One of the goals of this project is to make explicit the invisible heuristics and tacit knowledge that permeates mathematics, problem solving and proving in particular. Maybe I'll create a \"Heuristic index for abstract algebra\" at one point. From this, another ambitious goal emerges: making this project become a self-study guide of sorts. Time will tell if this is a tangible goal for this project, since this is an extracurricular activity for me. Structure of the project In general, I follow the structure of the book and every problem has its own page. E.g. Problem 35a . Note that I use latin letters in problem enumeration, that is, \"35a\" instead of \"35 \\alpha \". This is because of limitations of mkdocs , which I used to create this website (btw I like mkdocs, it's great). At the bottom of a problem page I'll sometimes post \"Additional thoughts\", where I plan posting thoughts on how I solved the problem, what heuristic I used, or whatever I have to say, so look out for those.

Let S be a semigroup with an element e such that ea = a = ae for all a \\in S . Show that e is unique.

Show that a nonempty subset H of a group G is a subgroup of G if and only if a, b \\in H implies ab^{-1} \\in H . Proof \" \\implies \" Assume H is subgroup of G This means that the following is true: a \\in H \\implies a^{-1} \\in H \\quad (1) a, b \\in H \\implies ab \\in H \\quad (2) We need to show a, b \\in H implies ab^{-1} \\in H . Let a, b \\in H . By (1) we have b^{-1} \\in H , that is a, b^{-1} \\in H . Now, by (2) , this implies that ab^{-1} \\in H , what we needed to show. \" \\Longleftarrow \" Assume a, b \\in H implies ab^{-1} \\in H We want to show that H is a subgroup of G . To do this, we need to show that: a \\in H \\implies a^{-1} \\in H \\quad (1) a, b \\in H \\implies ab \\in H \\quad (2) Proof for (1) : a \\in H \\implies a^{-1} \\in H Let a \\in H . By our assumption, for b = a , we get: aa^{-1} = e, where e is the identity element of G . So, we know that the identity element e is in H . Now, since e, a \\in H , again using the assumption, we get: ea^{-1} = a^{-1}. Thus, we have shown that a \\in H \\implies a^{-1} \\in H , and the proof for (1) is complete. Proof for (2) : a, b \\in H \\implies ab \\in H Let a, b \\in H . By (1), we know that b \\in H \\implies b^{-1} \\in H . Now, since a, b^{-1} \\in H , by the starting assumption, we get: a(b^{-1})^{-1} = ab. Thus, we have shown that a, b \\in H \\implies ab \\in H , and the proof for (2) is complete. Since (1) and (2) are true, H is indeed a subgroup of G , and the statement is proven. We proved both directions, the proof is complete. \\square Additional thoughts I had one doubt with this proof from which I learned something. I started this problem just playing around with the assumptions. The \" \\implies \" direction was very straightforward. For the \" \\Longleftarrow \" direction I again just started playing with the given assumption, trying to see if something will pop up. Along the way I noticed I could prove a^{-1} \\in H if e, a \\in H . But to do that I needed to show that e is in H . Then as I was moving symbols around, I realised that I can set b = a and use the assumption to show that e \\in H . While I was pretty sure I can set b=a due to my prior experience with proofs, I still had some doubts. I thought, there is no b \\neq a condition, so who says I can't put b = a ? I found this answer on MSE, here they brought to my attention the actual name of this rule of inference that allows us to to set a = x, b = y for whatever x, y \\in H . Also note that I used the same letters for the assumption and in the reasoning, the linked answer does it better by introducing the variable x . Right now I'm too lazy to change this in my proof, so I leave it as it is.","title":"Problem 35a."},{"location":"35a/#problem-35a","text":"Show that a nonempty subset H of a group G is a subgroup of G if and only if a, b \\in H implies ab^{-1} \\in H .","title":"Problem 35a."},{"location":"35a/#proof","text":"","title":"Proof"},{"location":"35a/#implies-assume-h-is-subgroup-of-g","text":"This means that the following is true: a \\in H \\implies a^{-1} \\in H \\quad (1) a, b \\in H \\implies ab \\in H \\quad (2) We need to show a, b \\in H implies ab^{-1} \\in H .
